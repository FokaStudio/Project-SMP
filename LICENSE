==================================================================

Idk how to write preamble's, so it will be like 9000x less official than it should

So well, it is what it says...
So the sotry begins when I was looking for a license for the PSMP's work, because
it wouldn't be pleasant for someone to steal MY work, license it first and claim themselves as the owners...

I have looked into several licenses. I have used GNU General Public License (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/) for quite long time,
but it is pretty strict... All changes need to be documented, free distribution, AWFULY LONG COPYRIGHT NOTICE...

And then was the moment when I have decided to switch...
I have considered a few others:

- CreativeCommons (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/)
- Do What The F*ck You Want To (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/wtfpl/)
- The Unlicense (https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)
- Don't Be A Dick License (http://dbad-license.org/)

Each one had smth I found missing.
AND THIS IS THE MOMENT I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT I CAN
LITERALLY MAKE MY OWN LICENSE...

And here we are right now!
This is a mix of GPL, CC, WTFPL, DBAD and Unlicense +
some of my own additional rules (but not too many)

Without any further boring talk of mine, here are all the
things that you have to make sure to respect when
doing anything around the repo or its contents:

  C) You are FORBIDDEN to sell any of the contents of this repo, regardless of modifications made. The work in there will always be free.

  D) You are FORBIDDEN to overally JUST BE A DICK WHEN IT COMES TO USING THIS REPO'S CONTENTS:
        
        Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

            1. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name (as stated in A)
            2. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick. (same, stated in A)
            3. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick. (WHY WOULD YOU EVEN DO THAT?)

It should be assumed that, given FokaStudio is the creator of Project; SMP and holds full copyright over all parts of it, that any part of this license can be overriden on an individual basis with Foka's permission.

If any condition is broken or a user is breaking the rules of Prohibited and Permitted uses, FokaStudio can take away their rights to use any of the work in this repo, and you should pray that he will give those back to you someday...
