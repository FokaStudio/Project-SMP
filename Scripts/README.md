# IMPORTANT
## Disabled files
**Files prefixed with a hyphen are disabled**
Meaning that file `-example` is in the server files, but not turned on (why? idk)

## Credits
Not everything here is ours, if smth isn't we leave appropiate credits and link to original in *CREDITS.md*

## Paid scripts
Yes, there are even scripts that are paid
If it required money to obtain, we will prefix it with *PREMIUM_* and insert link to the resource inside the file instead (commmits on those ones are limited to Foka and the server console)
