The Official repository for Project: SMP server
Yeah, that one

## A ~~Long~~ Brief history od Project: SMP
Project: SMP was started in June 2020, then known as AppleCraft, by FokaStudio as a small Minecraft SMP (Survival Multiplayer) to casually play with other people.The first project was made terribly and was a total failure due to the bad host and lack of moderation knowledge.


Foka decided to countinue the project, after the change of host on July he started making the server once again (which ended making it again at least 4 times, as other were malfunctioning).The server's name evolved few times, starting from AppleCraft. Then known as AppleRealms (but never released), CraftIdeal for 3 months (this one got released!) and finally known with today's name - **Project: SMP**.


Two more people joined the project since the moment it was a scratch - Duck_Giovanna and aimwar, who both are now Admins. (altough the first one rarely bothers with joining and decided to bring more live to #meme-dump :/)


The project has expanded and now it is a perfectly composed SMP, with almost all aspects of the game highly expanded, starting from simple things, like fixing some bugs, adding simple features through Magic and more mobs, ending at stuff related to world generation and improving Minecraft's structures.
### EXAMPLE FEATURES:
- Double Jump;
- New Items with unique use;
- New Blocks with unique look and crafting recipes;
- New Entities and Structures with new Loot and MORE new Items;
- Super complicated plot and pile of spaghetti I love to simply call **code**!



Yeah, that's a lot of text, I know!

## SAME AS ABOVE, BUT 90% SHORTER
But yeah, we are a small SMP (yes, Yet Another SMP). We know that Survival is the most popular game mode, so we wanted to expand it a bit...

OKAY, we have changed almost everything, and new changes are made everyday... :/

But well, it would have been boring otherwise, right?

I have to code 70% of the stuff, (which is mostly open sourced here) so I would really apprieciate if you would hit that *Sponsor* button, so I can have some more motivation to make stuff (and break it in order to do so...)
